1. I plan to make a recipe book that stores recipes locally and allows for importing of already made recipes through JSON files.
2.
a. Function to make a new recipe.

b. Function to list all recipes/descriptions of recipes.

c. Function to load in already made recipes through JSON file.


This program will allow you to make your own recipes with steps and ingredients and store them locally while also being able to load in already made recipes.
Some function names could include:
save_recipes
create_recipe
load_recipes
view_recipe
(all above would not need any parameters as there would be text prompts for all additional information)
some use cases include serving as a easy way to enter information while getting a specific data structure as an output.
The program can take in user input in an order clearly stated to the person running the code and JSON files are necessary for the program to read.
