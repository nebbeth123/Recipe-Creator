1. I plan to make a recipie book that stores recipies locally and allows for importing of already made recipies through JSON files.
2.
a. Function to make a new recipie.

b. Function to list all recipies/descriptions of recipies.

c. Function to load in already made recipies through JSON file.


This program will allow you to make your own recipies with steps and ingredients and store them locally while also being able to load in already made recipies.
Some function names could include:
save_recipies
create_recipie
load_recipies
view_recipie
(all above would not need any parameters as there would be text prompts for all additional information)
some use cases include serving as a easy way to enter information while getting a specific data structure as an output.
The program can take in user input in an order clearly stated to the person running the code and JSON files are necessary for the program to read.
