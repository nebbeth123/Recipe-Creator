1. I plan to make a memory game that shows different types of stimuli to see which type of stimuli is easier to remember. This can include photos, words, colors, etc. These will be sectioned off by type of stimuli and there will be time inbetween to refresh memory. There will then be a results screen showing the data and a conclusion based on that data.
2.
 a. Function to make a visual field and randomize which stimuli to show.
 b. Function to take user input and store those inputs.
 c. Function to print and visualize analyzed data.
