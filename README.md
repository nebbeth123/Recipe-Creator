1. I plan to make a memory game that shows different types of stimuli to see which type of stimuli is easier to remember. This can include photos, words, colors, etc. These will be sectioned off by type of stimuli and there will be time inbetween to refresh memory. There will then be a results screen showing the data and a conclusion based on that data.
2.
a. Function to make a visual field and randomize which stimuli to show.

b. Function to take user input and store those inputs.

c. Function to print and visualize analyzed data. 


This program will test your memory and if different types and styles of stimuli are easier or harder to remember. It will then give you an analysis based on 
your responses and score during the test. 
Some function names could include:
load_images
show_instructions
create_window 
create_labels
(all above would take self as parameters and are all to make the gui)
some use cases include testing different kinds of stumuli with memory while having a consistent system of data analysis. 
The program can take in user preference about how the test should be structured/how many types/how many stimuli will be shown
